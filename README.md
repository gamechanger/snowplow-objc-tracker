## Why did we fork https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-objc-tracker?

When we upgraded Odyssey from RxSwift 3.x to 4.x, we needed to upgrade every other dependency that depends on RxSwift, including [RxReachability](https://github.com/gamechanger/odyssey/pull/2222). Upgrading RxReachability included an upgrade to [ReachabilitySwift](https://github.com/ashleymills/Reachability.swift), which renamed it's module to Reachability. The module name change introduced a namespace collision with [Reachability](https://github.com/tonymillion/Reachability) in this library. We decided to make the Reachability dependency private to avoid the collision. You can read more about alternative strategies we pursued here: https://github.com/gamechanger/odyssey/pull/2222.
